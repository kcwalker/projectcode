      <h1>Things Fall Apart</h1>
      <p>The French and Indian War (1754-63) was the North American theatre of the 
      Seven Years' War (1756-63), which many scholars have referred to the first world war, encompassing theatres
      on every continent known at the time save Australia. Involving France, Great Britain, Austria, Spain, 
      several German/Imperial states, among others,the war was a political and economic disaster for France 
      and her monarch, Louis XV, and a major victory for Great Britain's newly-established House of Hanover, 
      who'd succeeded to the throne less than fifty years prior. </p>
