    <p>On the eve of the French Revolution, France was the second-largest nation in Europe (only the
    Russian Empire was bigger.). It was also one of of the poorest. Wars with her enemies 
    (chief among them Great Britain and Austria), combined with mismanagement of the nation's economy at the hands
    of Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XIV, and the allure of Enlightenment ideals of liberty and a free press, 
    had depleted the nation's finances and undermined the tenets that had held French society together.</p>
